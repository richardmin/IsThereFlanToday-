#Checks if there's Flan today.
Pretty much a joke script.

#Details
How it works is that the script generates a file "index.html" at a location based on if FEAST has Flan on the UCLA dining menu today http://menu.ha.ucla.edu/foodpro/.

How it's intended to work is you place this in your AutoCron folder and run it every 24 hours or so, and it'll automatically update the website which you display through some port forwarder such as NGINX.
